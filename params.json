{"name":"api-js","tagline":"","body":"Welcome to api-js.\r\n===================\r\n\r\n\r\nHey! I'm Josh. This is the github repo for my latest project **api-js**. **Api-js** is a javascript library built for people who want to access apis without writing complex scripts for days.\r\n\r\nI designed **api-js** to save people time, and allow all developers to access the fantastic json apis out there. I first started building **api-js** for my own use whilst building a Reddit web application.\r\n\r\n**api-js** allows Javascript Novices (and Javascript Ninjas) who wish to save time writing Api Calls to use a simple function to do everything they need.\r\n\r\nUsing **api-js** you can quickly write, in pure javascript, api calls which normally would require most users to use PHP and Python. This has two benifits:\r\n    1. It Saves You Time! - You can implement this function in 10 seconds whilst writing a script in PHP and Python could take hours.\r\n    2. It helps your server! - **api-js** does all the work client-side, this means your server does much less work than had you used PHP or Python.\r\n\r\n####What is it? How does it work?\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n**api-js** provides you with a set of javascript functions to easily, and quickly use apis in your code.\r\n\r\n> **Note:**\r\n\r\n> - **api-js** is still in development.\r\n> - Not All Planned Functions Have Been Implemented Yet. Please Check Here Lately for New Updates\r\n> - Currently Only Supports JSON apis.\r\n\r\n####How To Add it To Your Code?\r\n-------------\r\nIts Easy! Set Up a Normal HTML Document and Add:\r\n```\r\n    <script src = \"api.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\nInside Your Header\r\n\r\nThe **getJSON** function\r\n-------------\r\n##### Used For GET-ting JSON Apis. (Such as Reddit and Github)\r\n  To get a basic JSON Api you use this syntax:\r\n  ```\r\n   getJSON(url, successfunction);\r\n   ```\r\n  \r\n> ##### What Are The Parameters?\r\n\r\n> **URL** - The URL you wish to get the JSON from.\r\n\r\n> - eg. **http://api.reddit.com/r/funny/top** Is the URL for the top posts in r/funny\r\n> - eg **http://api.reddit.com/r/funny/top?limit=10** Is the URL for the top 10 posts in r/funny.\r\n\r\n> **Successfunction** - The function to be called when the data is returned.\r\n\r\n> - eg. **getJSON(url, function(data){console.log(data)})** Logs the returned data in the console\r\n> - eg  **getJSON(url, myfunction)** Executes a function you declair called myfunction.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### A Extremely Basic Demo\r\n\r\nWhat Really Shows How Useful **api.js** can be is this demo:\r\n  Using a question on stackoverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10341135/example-of-using-github-api-from-javascript) asking for help using the github api the complex solution required 8 lines of code, mine required 2 and produces perfectly readable code.\r\n```\r\n getJSON('https://api.github.com/users/funchal', function myfunction(data) {\r\n            console.log(data.name + \" has \" + data.public_repos + \" public repositories!\"); });\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### A More Advanced Demo\r\n\r\nThe code below when executed collects the top posts in /r/aww then executes the function I declaired called **success**.\r\nThe **success** function then sorts out an array of the posts from the json data. The function then goes through the posts one by one writing to an element called container a link to the image and the caption.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<body>\r\n    <h1> Demo A. </h1>\r\n    <div id=\"Container\"></div>\r\n    <script>\r\n        getJSON('http://api.reddit.com/r/aww/top', success);\r\n        \r\n        function success(data) {\r\n            redditPosts = data.data.children;\r\n\r\n            for (i = 0; i < redditPosts.length; i++) {\r\n                Post = redditPosts[i].data;\r\n                document.getElementById(\"Container\").innerHTML += \"<a href = '\" + Post.url + \"'>\" + Post.title + \"</a><br>\";\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    </script>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n> **Note:** Previously before using api.js to write out the exact same data required 24 lines. Using api.js it required 8 lines of javascript.\r\n\r\n### Support My Library\r\n\r\nPlease Support My Project By Using it!\r\n\r\n===================\r\nWhat are you waiting for? **Download It Now...**\r\n===================\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
