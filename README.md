Welcome to api-js.
===================


Hey! I'm Josh. This is the github repo for my latest project **api-js**. **Api-js** is a javascript library built for people who want to access apis without writing complex scripts for days.

I designed **api-js** to save people time, and allow all developers to access the fantastic json apis out there. I first started building **api-js** for my own use whilst building a Reddit web application.

What is it? How does it work?
-------------

**api-js** provides you with a set of javascript functions to easily, and quickly use apis in your code.

> **Note:**

> - **api-js** is still in development.
> - Not All Planned Functions Have Been Implemented Yet. Please Check Here Lately for New Updates
> - Currently Only Supports JSON apis.

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Create a document

The document panel is accessible using the <i class="icon-folder-open"></i> button in the navigation bar. You can create a new document by clicking <i class="icon-file"></i> **New document** in the document panel.

### Fenced code blocks

GitHub's fenced code blocks are also supported with **Highlight.js** syntax highlighting:

```
// Foo
var bar = 0;
```

> **Tip:** To use **Prettify** instead of **Highlight.js**, just configure the **Markdown Extra** extension in the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

> **Note:** You can find more information:
